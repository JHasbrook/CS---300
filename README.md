What problem were you solving in the projects for this course?
The goal was to create a system that could store, manage, and display information about academic courses, including identifiers, titles, and any prerequisite relationships, for a university client.

How did you approach the problem? Why are data structures important to understand?
The solution utilized a structured approach by leveraging the strengths of specific data structures to organize and retrieve course information efficiently. Data structures are fundamental to computer science as they dictate how data is stored and accessed, directly impacting the speed and reliability of operations. By analyzing the problem and considering the benefits of sorted data access, I opted for an approach that ensured performance and organization.

How did you overcome roadblocks encountered during the activities or project?
One significant challenge involved debugging issues related to handling large datasets. Initially, my approach worked well with smaller data but struggled when scaling up. By consulting resources and adjusting my implementation to better handle memory allocation and recursive operations, I resolved the problem. This experience underscored the importance of testing solutions with realistic data sizes.

How has this project influenced your approach to designing and developing software?
The project reinforced the importance of planning and considering scalability in software design. I gained a deeper understanding of how algorithmic efficiency Big-O notation and structured planning, such as flowcharts or pseudocode, play vital roles in creating solutions that are both practical and efficient. This has encouraged me to think critically about the long-term implications of design decisions.

How has this project changed the way you write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs?
I have become more aware of the need for clean, modular code. Separating core functionality into distinct files or classes would improve clarity and maintainability. While the projectâ€™s initial implementation bundled multiple components into a single file, I recognized that organizing these elements logically would make future updates or collaborations significantly easier. This experience has strengthened my commitment to writing adaptable and professional code.
